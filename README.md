# Ionic Cordova App Builder
So this is a project that should help you produce Android project and build or/and xCode Project for iOS using docker file only, so it is basically a command lines that makes things easier for you to produce the final app build.

These files can be placed inside ionic project to use.

## Usage
**First** you need to build and push builder image, it is separated to save time of rebuild that image everytime you need to build a new app, it is really waste of time if you build that image everytime.
Use the following commands:
```shell
docker build . -f ./app-builder.Dockerfile -t app-builder
docker push app-builder
```
*Note: You can change app-builder with whatever name you like, but you need to change that as well inside `Dockerfile`*

**Then**, you can use your image to build the app:
```shell
docker build . \
  --build-arg ENV_NAME="${ENV_NAME}" \
  --build-arg PACKAGE_ID="${PACKAGE_ID}" \
  --build-arg PLATFORM=${platform} \
  --build-arg VERSION="${version}" \
  -f ./Dockerfile \
  -t app-build
```

Arguments:
* `PACKAGE_ID`: is bundleId that you use for you app
* `ENV_NAME`: prod or dev, depends on what your files ionic project is called inside environments' folder.
* `PLATFORM`: `ios` or `android` or both using `all`
* `VERSION`: optional to override the version that specified inside `config.xml` file, please refer to `Dockerfile` and uncomment the line that specify it.

**Finally** to get the build out of that image:
For Android build:
```shell
docker run --user root:root --privileged=true -v ./build-output:/app/mount:Z --rm --entrypoint cp app-build -r ./output/android /app/mount
```

For iOS build (note you need to do pod install if you have firebasex):
```shell
docker run --user root:root --privileged=true -v ./build-output:/app/mount:Z --rm --entrypoint cp app-build -r ./output/ios /app/mount
cd ./build-output/ios && pod repo update && pod install
```

There is a build-app.sh file if you want to run all these steps using shell (you can comment first part from it later). 

Good Luck ðŸ§¡
